# project-curvature
Summer 2020 research project by David Nguyen and Dimple Sarnaaik with Dr. Vera Gluscevic at University of Southern California.

Goal: Explore the recent claims that there might be evidence that our universe has positive curvature. We will re-analyze Planck data using the existing cobaya code and explore how the results depend on the prior on curvature, Omega_K.
